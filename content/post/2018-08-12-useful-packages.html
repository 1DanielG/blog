<h1>Simplifying The Art Of Missing Values With <code>simputation</code></h1>
<p>Your data has ton of missing values. Imputation is critical for this real-world data set but dealing with missing values can be challenging. Should you just remove the data? Should you interpolate? Should you apply a complex algorithm?</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/markvanderloo/simputation">R package simputation</a> aggregates and simplifies the process of applying imputation techniques from various popular packages. More information here :</p>

<h1>Reproducibility Taken To The Next Level With <code>drake</code></h1>
<p><a href="https://ropensci.github.io/drake/">Perform reproducible analysis</a></p>
<p>What <code>drake</code> does well is to help us perform reproducible analysis.It’s the idea that any analysis should be able to reproduced in entirety by other people.</p>
<p>The magic is in the <code>drake_plan()</code> function. Basically, we can create an entire workflow with a few steps. Then, (here’s the magical part), <code>drake</code> remembers if anything changes in the future updating the pieces (data, inputs, variables, etc) adjusting the output accordingly.</p>

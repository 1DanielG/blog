# Copy excel data straight into R dataframes

- Quicker than quick. Copy data in excel and straight into an R dataframe! I won't need this data ever again, so why bother saving and loading a file?

```{r warning=FALSE , message=FALSE , results='hide'}
read.table(file = "clipboard" , sep = "\t" , header = TRUE)
```
